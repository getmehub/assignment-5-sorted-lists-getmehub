# A5 - Assignment 5: Sorted Lists
##Introduction
This assignment is intended to introduce you to a number of concepts in C++:
*C++ Arrays
*Pointers
*Linked Lists
*Overloading [] operators
You will be introduced to these concepts by programming a sorted list class.  In this version of the assignment, you'll be storing integers as the values in the list.
##Description
As with the previous assignment, you will again be given skeleton code for a class and unit tests.  Grading will be based solely on passing the unit tests!  

For this assignment, the class you are implementing is the SortedListA and SortedListL classes.  SortedListA and SortedListL have the identical API, but SortedListA is implemented using arrays, and SortedListL is implemented using linked lists.  For both classes, each time an element is inserted or deleted, the list is kept in order.

###SortedListL
This class stores a sorted list of integers as a singly-linked-list.

###SortedListA
This class stores a sorted list of integers as a single dimensional array of ints.
