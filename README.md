# CSC 340 Summer 2016 
# A5 - Assignment 5: Sorted Lists

This assignment is intended to introduce :
* C++ dynamic arrays
* C++ pointers & pointer manipulation
* Linked lists
* Overriding subscript operator
* Overloading stream insertion operator
* Introduction to Doxygen comments

implementing is the SortedListA and SortedListL classes.  SortedListA and SortedListL have the identical API, but SortedListA is implemented using arrays, and SortedListL is implemented using linked lists.  

Full class documentation is available in the respective header and implementation files.

Note:  To exit a program with an error, use exit(EXIT_FAILURE).  EXIT_FAILURE is included from stdlib.h.
